	<p>BASIC - This is a basic CAD service that has included a 1st-check for CAD quality by the allocated CAD designer. Lead times on this option include allowance for us to plan the work effectively with our current workload to reduce cost.</p>
	 <p>CHECKED - This is the next level of service that also includes a 2nd-check by one of our in-house engineers and usually comes with an attached report detailing any assumptions, suggestions and consultancy. This is with the aim of producing the highest quality and technically correct drawings. If required, a direct line of communication is opened between the designer and customer for the fastest turnaround of any queries. We do not like making assumptions, and will ask if in doubt about a certain aspect of a drawing. Any assumptions we have made shall be documented on the first submission on the return correspondence.</p>
	 <p>EXPRESS - Our express service is a priority service for projects on tight deadlines. International customers can also benefit from an overnight service where international time differences are in favour.</p>
